# Cool Gitty Peeps: A GitHub Profiles Search App

The Cool Gitty Peeps search app is a simple GitHub profiles search app that enables the user to search a GitHub profile by username to see the basic information of that particular profile. Searching and viewing a GitHub profile through [GitHub](https://github.com) can be confusing at times, especially for new users, where you see a long list of repositories and not so much the basic information about the profile itself.

Every username, whether it belongs to an individual, business, or organization, is unique to one another that there should not be any duplicate usernames with different profiles underneath. When searching by username, the app will only retrieve one result because of the username's uniqueness. This is especially helpful to prevent the user from searching by the user's real name or by any other keyword, only to have a long list of profiles returned after the search.

## Featured Results

In every username searched, you will receive the following under the ***Profiles I Found*** section below the search bar:

- The profile's bio if there is any available
- The profile's number of followers
- The number of GitHub profiles the user is following
- The number of public repos the user has in their profile
- The profile's linked Twitter handle if provided
- The profile's location if provided
- A small list of the user's repos that can be expanded and collapsed.
- The small list of the user's repos are also linked for the user to visit the direct link to the repo's page
